HOTSPOT -
You need to create an Azure Storage account that meets the following requirements:
✑ Minimizes costs
✑ Supports hot, cool, and archive blob tiers
✑ Provides fault tolerance if a disaster affects the Azure region where the account resides
How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
![](images/0014700004.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0014800001.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Box 1: StorageV2 -
You may only tier your object storage data to hot, cool, or archive in Blob storage and General Purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts. General Purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts do not support tiering.
General-purpose v2 accounts deliver the lowest per-gigabyte capacity prices for Azure Storage, as well as industry-competitive transaction prices.
Box 2: Standard_GRS -
Geo-redundant storage (GRS): Cross-regional replication to protect against region-wide unavailability.
Incorrect Answers:
Locally-redundant storage (LRS): A simple, low-cost replication strategy. Data is replicated within a single storage scale unit.
Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica. RA-GRS provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to geo-replication across two regions, but is more expensive compared to GRS.

The budget alerts are for Resource Group RG1, which include VM1, but not VM2. However, when the budget thresholds you've created are exceeded, only notifications are triggered. None of your resources are affected and your consumption isn't stopped.
Box 2: one email notification will be sent each month.
Budget alerts for Resource Group RG1, which include VM1, but not VM2.VM1 consumes 20 Euro/day. The 50%, 500 Euro limit, will be reached in 25 days, and an email will be sent.
The 70% and 100% alert conditions will not be reached within a month, and they don't trigger email actions anyway.
Credit alerts: Credit alerts are generated automatically at 90% and at 100% of your Azure credit balance. Whenever an alert is generated, it's reflected in cost alerts and in the email sent to the account owners. 90% and 100% will not be reached though.

_Explanation:_
Box 1: 2 -
Use two fault domains.
2 or 3 is max, depending on which region you are in.
Box 2: 20 -
Use 20 for platformUpdateDomainCount
Increasing the update domain (platformUpdateDomainCount) helps with capacity and availability planning when the platform reboots nodes. A higher number for the pool (20 is max) means that fewer of their nodes in any given availability set would be rebooted at once.

![](images/0041600001.jpg)
For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
![](images/0041700001.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0041700002.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Box 1: Yes -
A Basic Load Balancer supports virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set.
Box 2: Yes -
When using load-balancing rules with Azure Load Balancer, you need to specify health probes to allow Load Balancer to detect the backend endpoint status. The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determine which backend pool instances will receive new flows. You can use health probes to detect the failure of an application on a backend endpoint. You can also generate a custom response to a health probe and use the health probe for flow control to manage load or planned downtime. When a health probe fails, Load Balancer will stop sending new flows to the respective unhealthy instance. Outbound connectivity is not impacted, only inbound connectivity is impacted.
Box 3: No -

NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
![](images/0041900001.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0041900002.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Change the private IP address of VM1 to static
Box 1: Remove the public IP address from VM1
Note: A public load balancer can provide outbound connections for virtual machines (VMs) inside your virtual network. These connections are accomplished by translating their private IP addresses to public IP addresses. Public Load Balancers are used to load balance internet traffic to your VMs.
Box 2: Create and configure an NSG
NSGs are used to explicitly permit allowed traffic. If you do not have an NSG on a subnet or NIC of your virtual machine resource, traffic is not allowed to reach this resource.

### Question 420: Question #47 Topic 5

HOTSPOT -
You plan to use Azure Network Watcher to perform the following tasks:

✑ Task2: Validate outbound connectivity from an Azure virtual machine to an external host.
Which feature should you use for each task? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
![](images/0042400001.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0042500001.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Box 1: IP flow verify -
At some point, a VM may become unable to communicate with other resources, because of a security rule. The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which.
Box 2: Connection troubleshoot -
Diagnose outbound connections from a VM: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a
URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does. Learn more about how to troubleshoot connections using connection-troubleshoot.

![](images/0042900002.png)
You need to identify which resources you can move from RG1 to RG2, and which resources you can move from RG2 to RG1.
Which resources should you identify? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.
NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.
Hot Area:
![](images/0043000001.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0043100001.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Box 1: IP1, Storage1 -
IP addresses and storage accounts can be moved.
Virtual networks cannot be moved.
There is no lock on RG1.
Box 2: None -
There is a delete lock on RG2.
Note: When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all resources within that scope inherit the same lock. Even resources you add later inherit the lock from the parent.
The most restrictive lock in the inheritance takes precedence.
CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the resource.
ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource. Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0046000002.jpg)

_Explanation:_
Box 1: No -
Azure DNS provides automatic registration of virtual machines from a single virtual network that's linked to a private zone as a registration virtual network. VM5 does not belong to the registration virtual network though.
Box 2: No -
Forward DNS resolution is supported across virtual networks that are linked to the private zone as resolution virtual networks. VM5 does belong to a resolution virtual network.
Box 3: Yes -
VM6 belongs to registration virtual network, and an A (Host) record exists for VM9 in the DNS zone.
By default, registration virtual networks also act as resolution virtual networks, in the sense that DNS resolution against the zone works from any of the virtual machines within the registration virtual network.

_Explanation:_
Box 1: Yes -
The inbound security rule for NSG1 allows TCP port 1433 from 10.10.2.0/24 (or Subnet2 where VM2 and VM3 are located) to 10.10.1.0/24 (or Subnet1 where
VM1 is located) while the inbound security rule for NSG2 blocks TCP port 1433 from 10.10.2.5 (or VM2) to 10.10.1.5 (or VM1). However, the NSG1 rule has a higher priority (or lower value) than the NSG2 rule.
Box 2: Yes -
No rule explicitly blocks communication from VM1. The default rules, which allow communication, are thus applied.
Box 3: Yes -
No rule explicitly blocks communication between VM2 and VM3 which are both on Subnet2. The default rules, which allow communication, are thus applied.

Hot Area:
![](images/0050200001.jpg)

**Correct Answer:** ![](images/0050200002.jpg)

_Explanation:_
IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to:
✑ Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface.
Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations.
The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it.
Box 1: Yes -
The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1.
Box 2: No -
VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1.
Box 3: Yes -
The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3. IP forwarding on VM3 allows VM1 to connect to VM2 via VM3.
